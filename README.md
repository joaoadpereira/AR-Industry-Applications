# Augmented Reality applications for Industry 

Unity project with several scenes developed for Microsoft HoloLens. it aims to show different applications of Augmented Reality in the industry: to display CAD models, to review product design and to instruct/teach.

### 1 Motivation 

The industry seeks new technologies and tools to achieve efficient solutions, either to develop new products or to manufacture as efficiently as possible. Augmented Reality technology has great applicability in industry. This can be achieved with Microsoft HoloLens, providing the combination of a video camera and the dispose of holograms in the real world. The users can interact with these virtual objects with their fingers. 

This project intends to show how this technology may be applied in the industry through 3 different applications: display CAD models from complex technical drawings, review different product solutions and teach possible users/operators new processes. This allows the different stockholders (e.g. designers, engineers, customers, professional users) with different backgrounds to increase their levels of engagement on their complex tasks.

The results of this project were presented on [the Roadshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwv1fVc4s4) of [the Mobile VR/AR project](https://www.seamk.fi/yrityksille/tki-projektit/mobiilivrar/).   

Tools used: [SpaceClaim](http://www.spaceclaim.com/en/default.aspx), [AGX Momentum](https://www.algoryx.se/momentum/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia?cl1=AR_Vuforia_General_Google_CLC-cpc-ARBrandedxxxVuforiaUKNordics-38010&cmsrc=Google&cid=7015A000001oRiBQAU&elqCampaignId=13184&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIotbGw6aw6QIVxbUYCh03BgbdEAAYASAAEgJ7GvD_BwE), [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity), [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)

### 2 Display CAD models from technical drawings

This HoloLens app shows the CAD models associated with 2 technical drawings that act as image targets. When the user focuses on the targets, the models automatically are disposed of. Moreover, the user may enable external features of the design as dynamic simulation, exploded view, visualize further detailed information, watch a video of its manufacturing simulation and enable real size view of the CAD model. 

The models were built in with [SpaceClaim](http://www.spaceclaim.com/en/default.aspx). The project was set up with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and [Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia?cl1=AR_Vuforia_General_Google_CLC-cpc-ARBrandedxxxVuforiaUKNordics-38010&cmsrc=Google&cid=7015A000001oRiBQAU&elqCampaignId=13184&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIotbGw6aw6QIVxbUYCh03BgbdEAAYASAAEgJ7GvD_BwE) (figure bellow) and deployed to [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

You can watch the results through [this video](https://youtu.be/NJM80PS2epg). Technical drawings may achieve complex levels in engineering but Augmented Reality technology has the power to simplify them.   




 

### 3 Review product design

When developing a new product, design variants requires to be discussed with different stockholders (e.g. designers, engineers, customers, professional users). The discussion many times passes through evaluating and testing prototypes. 

On this app, it is reviewed 3 different CAD solutions of snowplough (figures below) to attach to a Harvester machine. The user interface was set up with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and deployed to [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).

You can watch the results through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlznWJ-maCg). This app shows how prototype review may be achieved with Augmented Reality, visualizing the different virtual model solutions and allowing their dynamic simulation, detailed information, exploded view and background context (model attached to the Harvester).





### 4 Teach

Share knowledge and the know-how is an essential process inside industry to complete or solve hard tasks. Augmented Reality, through the disposal of digital holograms in the real world may assist users on their daily operations.

This Microsoft HoloLens app helps the user to disassemble the product and achieve the electronic components for possible maintenance, providing a step-by-step tutorial.  The app was designed up with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity), [Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia?cl1=AR_Vuforia_General_Google_CLC-cpc-ARBrandedxxxVuforiaUKNordics-38010&cmsrc=Google&cid=7015A000001oRiBQAU&elqCampaignId=13184&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIotbGw6aw6QIVxbUYCh03BgbdEAAYASAAEgJ7GvD_BwE) (figure bellow) and deployed to [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).
