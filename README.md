# Augmented Reality applications for Industry 

Unity project with several scenes developed for Microsoft HoloLens. it aims to show different applications of Augmented Reality in the industry: to display CAD models, to review product design and to instruct/teach.

### 1 Display CAD models from technical drawings

This HoloLens app shows the CAD models associated with 2 tecnhical drawings that act as image targets. When the user focus on the targets, the models automecally are disposed. Moreover, the user may enable external features of the design as dynamic simulation, exploded view, visualize further detailed information, watch video of its manufacturing simulation and enable real size view of the CAD model.
